<h3>Java ExecutorCompletionService Framework, Java ConcurrentHashMap, and Fair Semaphore (Assignment 3 - Part B)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Objectives and Overview of the Assignment</H4>

<P>The objective of this part of the assignment is to learn how to
synchronize Beings in Middle-Earth via a ConcurrentHashMap and a fair
semaphore that's implemented using the <A
HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/specific-notification.pdf"><EM>Specific
Notification</EM></A> pattern.  Videos describing the relevant topics
appear as follows:

<UL>
<LI> <B>Java ConcurrentHashMap</B> -- <A

</UL>

<UL>
<LI> <B>Specific Notification pattern</B> -- <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fegw8P8o5FI">here</a>.
</UL>

Please watch these videos to ensure you understand these Java
synchronizers and patterns.  Naturally, we'll cover these topics in
class, as well. </P>

<P>In this part of the assignment you will enhance the
PalantiriManager portion of the PalantiriSimulator app from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS254/tree/master/assignments/assignment3a/">Assignment
3A</A>, which implemented the BeingManager via the Java
ExecutorCompletionService and ExecutorService concurrency frameworks.
Assignment 3B focuses on applying a ConcurrentHashMap and a
<EM>Specific Notification</EM>-based ``fair'' semaphore to the
PalantiriManager, which is used to restrict the number of Beings from
Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into a fixed number of
Palantiri. </P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project using the
latest version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin
and Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 3B, however, you only need to be aware of the
following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore/">simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as
described <A HREF="#description">below</A>. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of unit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for the assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.  <P>

</UL>

<P>You'll also need to integrate your enhanced solution for the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/completionService">completionService</A>
folder from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS254/tree/master/assignments/assignment3a/">Assignment
3A</a> into the latest/greatest <CODE>completionService</CODE>
skeleton and use it as implementation of the BeingManager for
Assignment 3B (make sure to address all my comments from Assignment 3A
into your Assignment 3B solution). </P>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 29, so you will need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 29, though I recommend you use API 30.  If you don't already
have an emulator created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD
Manager" button in the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore">concurrentMapFairSemaphore</A>
folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore/ConcurrentMapFairSemaphoreMgr.java">ConcurrentMapFairSemaphoreMgr.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to implement a
PalantiriManager via a ConcurrentHashMap and a FairSemaphore.  </P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore/FairSemaphoreMO.java">FairSemaphoreMO.java</A>. Undergraduate
students need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement a ``fair semaphore'' using built-in Java monitor
objects. </P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/concurrentMapFairSemaphore/FairSemaphoreCO.java">FairSemaphoreCO.java</A>. Graduate
students need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement a ``fair semaphore'' using Java ReentrantLocks and
ConditionObjects. </P>

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/utils/Student.kt">Student.kt</A>.
You need to complete the "TODO" task to set the <CODE>type</CODE>
field to either <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or <CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI> <P>

</UL>

<P>Your app will be considered correct if it (1) passes all the unit
and instrumentation tests and (2) all beings successfully complete all
their N iterations.  A correct simulation should restrict the number
of gazing Beings to the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there
are four Palantiri in the simulation, then only four Beings should
ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show Palantiri and Being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct---and does not throw any exceptions---then the app title bar
labels will appear <EM>green</EM> when the simulation completes. If
your solution is not implemented correctly---or throws an
exception---then <EM>red</EM> title bar labels will be displayed when
the simulation completes.</P>

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS254/tree/master/assignments/assignment3b/">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. </P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A> folder
are provided to increase our confidence that your implementation is
working as expected.  It's essential that you use the Android Studio
GUI to run these unit tests locally on your computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code.  However, please run these tests prior to submitting your
solution and make sure to seek help if you have questions about why
any of the tests fail.  </p>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This part of the assignment is designed to deepen your
understanding of synchronizing multi-threaded programs using the Java
ConcurrentHashMap and the <A
HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/specific-notification.pdf"><EM>Specific
Notification</EM></A> pattern.  The fair semaphore implementation is
tricky, so please start early and come to office hours if you have any
questions. </P>
