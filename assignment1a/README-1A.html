<h3>Java Threads (Assignment 1 - Part A)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Objectives and Overview of the Assignment</H4>

<P>The objective of the first part of this assignment is to learn how
to create, start, and join Java threads.  Videos explaining the
structure, functionality, and usage of Java threads appear <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxpjEXt7J0g&index=6&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&t=15s">here</a>,
<A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ij9Q4AGfgc&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=7">here</a>,
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdrXGs2Ipp4&index=8&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3">here</a>.
I recommend you watch these videos to ensure you understand how to
program Java threads.  Naturally, we'll cover these topics in class,
as well. </P>

<P>In the first part of this assignment you'll use Java threads to
create a working Android app called PalantiriSimulator.  This app
contains a resource manager that restricts the number of beings from
Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into a fixed number of
palantiri.  If you're not yet a fan of Tolkien's <A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">Lord of the
Rings</A> trilogy, you can learn more about palantiri <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir">here</a>.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project using the
latest version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin
and Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of this assignment, however, you just need to focus on the
following three folders:</P>

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/runnableThreads/">simulator/managers/beings/runnableThreads</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of unit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for the assignment.</LI> <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.</LI> <P>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 29, so you'll need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 29, though I recommend you use API 30. If you don't already
have an emulator created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD
Manager" button in the Android Studio IDE.</>

<HR width=50% align=left> <A name="description"> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>Nested within the <A HREF="app/src/main">app/src/main</A> folder
you'll find many folders and files, most of which you can ignore.  In
particular, this Android program is structured in accordance with the
<A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern.  Most classes are already provided for you.  The
relevant concurrent processing is performed in the Model layer.  If
you correctly complete the implementation of skeleton(s) in the Model
layer the app should successfully run to completion without throwing
any exceptions.</P>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/runnableThreads">simulator/managers/beings/runnableThreads</A>
folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/runnableThreads/RunnableThreadsMgr.java">simulator/managers/beings/runnableThreads/RunnableThreadsMgr.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in (1) the
<CODE>newBeing()</CODE> method, which is a factory method that returns
a new <CODE>SimpleBeingRunnable</CODE> instance, (2) the
<CODE>runSimulation()</CODE> method, which calls a method to
create/start a thread for each being, and then calls another method to
start a thread to wait for all the being threads to finished, and then
blocks until the waiter thread has finished, (3) the
<CODE>beginBeingThreads()</CODE> method, which creates/starts a list
of threads that represent the beings in this simulation, and (4) the
<CODE>waitForBeingThreads()</CODE> method, which starts a thread to
wait for all the being threads to finish and returns that thread to
the caller. </P>

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/runnableThreads/SimpleBeingRunnable.java">simulator/managers/beings/runnableThreads/SimpleBeingRunnable.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in (1) the
<CODE>acquirePalantirAndGaze()</CODE> method, which performs a single
gazing operation. <P>

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/utils/Student.kt">Student.kt</A>.
You need to complete the "TODO" task to set the <CODE>type</CODE>
field to <CODE>Graduate</CODE>.</LI> <P>

</UL>

<P>Your app will be considered correct if it (1) passes all the unit
and instrumentation tests and (2) all beings successfully complete all
their N iterations.  A correct simulation should restrict the number
of gazing Beings to the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there
are four Palantiri in the simulation, then only four Beings should
ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show Palantiri and Being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct---and does not throw any exceptions---then the app title bar
labels will appear <EM>green</EM> when the simulation completes. If
your solution is not implemented correctly---or throws an
exception---then <EM>red</EM> title bar labels will be displayed when
the simulation completes.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left> <A NAME="gradwork"> <H4>Additional "TO DO"
Tasks for Graduate Students</H4>

<P>Graduate students must perform the following additional
task(s):</P>

<UL>

<LI> Enhance the beginBeingThreads() method in <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/runnableThreads/RunnableThreadsMgr.java">RunnableThreadsMgr.java</A>
to set an "UncaughtExceptionHandler" that calls the
BeingManager.error() to indicate an unexpected exception "ex" occurred
for thread "thr".

<LI> In general, enhance the <CODE>RunnableThreadsMgr.java</CODE> file
to use Java functional programming features (e.g., method references
and/or lambda expressions).  Likewise, if you are familiar with the
Java Streams framework please feel free to apply it to your solution.
</UL>

<P>Undergraduates are welcome to implement these methods/features, but
it's not required.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5254/tree/master/assignment1a/">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly marked.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A> folder
are provided to increase our confidence that your implementation is
working as expected.  It's essential that you use the Android Studio
GUI to run these unit tests locally on your computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code.  However, make sure to run these tests prior to submitting
your solution and seek help if you have questions about why any of the
tests fail.  </p>

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with writing
multi-threaded programs using the Android Studio IDE and core Java
concurrency mechanisms.  It doesn't require you to program with any
Java synchronization mechanisms (which we'll cover in the next part of
this assignment) or complex Java executor framework and Android
concurrency/communication frameworks (which we'll cover in upcoming
assignments).</P>
