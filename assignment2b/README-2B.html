<h3>Java ExecutorService Framework and Core Synchronizers (Assignment 2 - Part B)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Objectives and Overview of the Assignment</H4>

<P>The objective of the second part of this assignment is to learn how
to synchronize Java threads via core synchronizers, including a
recursive mutex (Java ReentrantLock) and a semaphore (which you
implement using a Java ReentrantLock and a ConditionObject).  Videos
describing the relevant Java synchronizers appear as follow:

<UL>
<LI> <B>Semaphore</B> -- <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsQlNd3_kKU&t=5s&index=18&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3">here</a>
and <A

<LI> <B>ReentrantLock</B> -- <A

and <A

<LI> <B>ConditionObject</B> <A

and <A

</UL>

I recommend you watch these videos to ensure you understand these Java
synchronizers.  Naturally, we'll cover these topics in class, as
well. </P>

<P>In this part of the assignment you will use a semaphore and
reentrant lock to enhance the ExecutorService thread-pool
implementation of the PalantiriSimulator app from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5254/tree/master/assignment2a/">Assignment
2A</A>. Assignment 2B focuses on the PalantiriManager, which is used
to restrict the number of Beings from Middle-Earth who can
concurrently gaze into a fixed number of palantiri. </P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project using the
latest version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin
and Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.

For the purposes of Assignment 2B, however, you only need to be aware
of the following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/reentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphore/">simulator/managers/palantiri/reentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphore</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of unit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for this assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.  <P>

</UL>

<P>You'll also need to integrate your solution for the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/executorService">executorService</A>
folder from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5254/tree/master/assignment2a/">Assignment
2A</a> into the latest/greatest <CODE>executorService</CODE> skeleton
and use it as implementation of the BeingManager for Assignment 2B.
Make sure you address all my comments on your Assignment 2A solution
before using this code as the basis for Assignment 2B. </P>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 29, so you will need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 29, though I recommend you use API 30.  If you don't already
have an emulator created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD
Manager" button in the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<A name="description">
<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/reentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphore">reentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphore</A>
folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/reentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphore/SimpleSemaphore.java">SimpleSemaphore.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to define a
counting semaphore with "fair" semantics that are implemented using a
Java ReentrantLock and ConditionObject. </P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/reentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphore/ReentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphoreMgr.java">ReentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphoreMgr.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement a PalantiriManager via an instance of your SimpleSemaphore,
a ReentrantLock, and a HashMap. Students taking the class for graduate
credit must implement certain methods using the Java Streams
framework, as described <A HREF="#gradwork">below</A>.

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/utils/Student.kt">Student.kt</A>.
You need to complete the "TODO" task to set the <CODE>type</CODE>
field to either <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or <CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI> <P>

</UL>

<P>Your app will be considered correct if it (1) passes all the unit
and instrumentation tests and (2) all beings successfully complete all
their N iterations.  A correct simulation should restrict the number
of gazing Beings to the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there
are four Palantiri in the simulation, then only four Beings should
ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show Palantiri and Being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct---and does not throw any exceptions---then the app title bar
labels will appear <EM>green</EM> when the simulation completes. If
your solution is not implemented correctly---or throws an
exception---then <EM>red</EM> title bar labels will be displayed when
the simulation completes.</P>

<A NAME="gradwork">
<H4>Additional "TO DO" Tasks for Graduate Students</H4>

<P>Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for
graduate credit) must perform the following additional task(s):</P>

<UL> 

<LI> Enhance the
<CODE>ReentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphoreMgr.java</CODE> file to use
the Java Streams framework in several places. <P>

</UL>

<P>Undergraduates are welcome to implement these Java functional
programming enhancements, but it's not required.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5254/tree/master/assignment2a/">GitHub</a>
account.  Now that you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly indicated.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A> folder
are provided to increase our confidence that your implementation is
working as expected.  It's essential that you use the Android Studio
GUI to run these unit tests locally on your computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code.  However, please run these tests prior to submitting your
solution and make sure to seek help if you have questions about why
any of the tests fail.  </p>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This part of the assignment is designed to get you familiar with
synchronizing multi-threaded programs using core Java synchronizers
that are more powerful than the spin-locks we covered in Assignment
1B.  It doesn't require you to program any new Java or Android
concurrency frameworks, which we'll cover in upcoming assignments.</P>
