<h3>Java ExecutorCompletionService Framework, Java ConcurrentHashMap, and Fair Semaphore (Assignment 3 - Part A)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Objectives and Overview of the Assignment</H4>

<P>The objective of the first part of this assignment is to learn how
to use the Java ExecutorCompletionService framework.  Videos
describing this framework appear <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bl9GyGf4qs&index=49&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIeqBOFPz6I&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=50">here</a>.
I recommend you watch these videos to ensure you understand the Java
ExecutorCompletionService.  Naturally, we'll also cover these topics
in class. <P>

In this part of the assignment you'll use an instance of the Java
ExecutorCompletionService class that's associated with a "cached" pool
of threads to augment the fixed-sized thread pool implementation of
the PalantiriSimulator app from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS254/tree/master/assignment2a/">Assignment
2A</A>. Assignment 3A focuses on creating a cached pool of threads
that allow Beings from Middle-Earth to concurrently gaze into a given
number of Palantiri.

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project using the
latest version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin
and Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 3A, however, you only need to be aware of the
following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/completionService">simulator/managers/beings/completionService</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as
described <A HREF="#description">below</A>. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of unit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for the assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.  <P>

</UL>

<P>You'll also need to integrate your enhanced solution for the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/reentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphore">reentrantLockHashMapSimpleSemaphore</A>
folder from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS254/tree/master/assignments/assignment2b/">Assignment
2B</a> and use it as implementation of the PalantiriManager for
Assignment 3A (please address all my comments from Assignment 2B in
your Assignment 3A solution). </P>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 29, so you will need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 29, though I recommend you use API 30.  If you don't already
have an emulator created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD
Manager" button in the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left> <A name="description"> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/completionService">completionService</A>
folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/completionService/ExectorCompletionServiceMgr.java">ExectorCompletionServiceMgr.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement a BeingManager via a cached thread pool using the Java
ExecutorService and ExecutorCompletionService. </P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/completionService/BeingCallable.java">BeingCallable.java</A>.
You'll need to complete a couple of methods in this class, which
should look very familiar by now.  </P>

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/utils/Student.kt">Student.kt</A>.
You need to complete the "TODO" task to set the <CODE>type</CODE>
field to either <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or <CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI> <P>

</UL>

<P>Your app will be considered correct if it (1) passes all the unit
and instrumentation tests and (2) all beings successfully complete all
their N iterations.  A correct simulation should restrict the number
of gazing Beings to the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there
are four Palantiri in the simulation, then only four Beings should
ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show Palantiri and Being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct---and does not throw any exceptions---then the app title bar
labels will appear <EM>green</EM> when the simulation completes. If
your solution is not implemented correctly---or throws an
exception---then <EM>red</EM> title bar labels will be displayed when
the simulation completes.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left> <A NAME="gradwork"> <H4>Additional "TO DO"
Tasks for Graduate Students</H4>

<P>Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for
graduate credit) must perform the following additional task(s):</P>

<UL>
<LI> Enhance the <CODE>ExecutorCompletionServiceMgr.java</CODE> file
to use Java method references and/or lambda expressions as instructed.
</UL>

<P>Undergraduates are welcome to implement these methods/features, but
it's not required.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A> folder
are provided to increase our confidence that your implementation is
working as expected.  It's essential that you use the Android Studio
GUI to run these unit tests locally on your computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code.  However, please run these tests prior to submitting your
solution and make sure to seek help if you have questions about why
any of the tests fail.  </p>

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS254/tree/master/assignment3a/">GitHub</a>
account.  Now that you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can simply
pull this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
complete the "TODO" markers. </P>

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This part of the assignment is intended to deepen your knowledge of
writing concurrent Java programs using a cached thread pool in
conjunction with the Java ExecutorCompletionService.  This solution
enhances the Java ExecutorService mechanisms covered in Assignment 2A
by eliminating the need for an external queue of futures and ensuring
that task results are processed as soon as the tasks complete.</P>
