<h3>Java Fork-Join Framework, Barrier Synchronizers, and Readers/Writer Synchronizers (Assignment 4 - Part B)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Objectives and Overview of the Assignment</H4>

<P>The objectives of this assignment are to learn how to synchronize
concurrent Being gazes via a readers-writer lock (implemented using a
Java StampedLock) and a fair semaphore (implemented using your
solution to <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS254/tree/master/assignments/assignment3b/">assignment
3b</a>).  Videos describing Java StampedLocks appear <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QER63oNLpAE&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=51">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2ywEZ9sZSU&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=52">here</a>.
I recommend you watch these videos to ensure you understand Java
StampedLocks.  Naturally, this topic is covered in class, as
well. </P>

<P>The fair semaphore and a Java StampedLock are used to enhance the
Java Fork-Join framework implementation of the PalantiriSimulator app
from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS254/tree/master/assignments/assignment4a/">Assignment
4A</A>. Assignment 4B focuses on the PalantiriManager, which is used
to restrict the number of Beings from Middle-Earth who can
concurrently gaze into a fixed number of Palantiri. </P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project using the
latest version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin
and Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.

For the purposes of Assignment 4B, however, you only need to be aware
of the following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore/">simulator/managers/palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of unit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for this assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.  <P>

</UL>

<P>You'll also need to integrate your enhanced solution for the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/forkJoinPool">forkJoinPool</A>
folder from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS254/tree/master/assignments/assignment4a/">Assignment
4A</a> into the latest/greatest <CODE>forkJoinPool</CODE> skeleton and
use it as the implementation of the BeingManager for Assignment 4B
(please address all my comments from Assignment 4A into your
Assignment 4B solution). </P>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 29, so you will need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 29, though I recommend you use API 30.  If you don't already
have an emulator created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD
Manager" button in the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore">stampedLockFairSemaphore</A>
folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore/stampedLockFairSemaphoreMgr.java">stampedLockFairSemaphoreMgr.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to implement a
PalantiriManager via your FairSemaphore implementation, a StampedLock,
and a HashMap.  </P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore/FairSemaphoreMO.java">FairSemaphoreMO.java</A>
or <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore/FairSemaphoreCO.java">FairSemaphoreCO.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to implement the
counting semaphore (implemented using your solution to <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS254/tree/master/assignments/assignment3b/">assignment
3b</a>) with either a built-in Java monitor object (if you're an
undergraduate) or a Java Condition Object and ReentrantLock (if you're
a graduate student). </P>

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/utils/Student.kt">Student.kt</A>.
You need to complete the "TODO" task to set the <CODE>type</CODE>
field to either <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or <CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI> <P>

</UL>

<P>Your app will be considered correct if it (1) passes all the unit
and instrumentation tests and (2) all Beings successfully complete all
their N iterations.  A correct simulation should restrict the number
of gazing Beings to the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there
are four Palantiri in the simulation, then only four Beings should
ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show Palantiri and Being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct---and does not throw any exceptions---then the app title bar
labels will appear <EM>green</EM> when the simulation completes. If
your solution is not implemented correctly---or throws an
exception---then <EM>red</EM> title bar labels will be displayed when
the simulation completes.</P>

<H4>Additional "TO DO" Tasks for Graduate Students</H4>

<P>Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
credit) must perform the following additional task(s):</P>

<UL>

<LI> Enhance the <CODE>StampedLockSimpleSemaphoreMgr.java</CODE> file
to use Java functional programming features (such as method
references, lambda expressions, and/or sequential streams) in several
places.

</UL>

<P>Undergraduates are welcome to implement these Java functional
programming enhancements, but it's not required.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS254/tree/master/assignments/assignment4b/">GitHub</a>
account.  Now that you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly marked.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This part of the assignment is designed to deepen your
understanding of synchronizing multi-threaded programs using Java
StampedLocks, which are more powerful, more complex, and (sometimes)
more efficient readers-writer synchronizers compared with the
spin-locks and ReentrantLocks we covered in previous assignments. </P>
