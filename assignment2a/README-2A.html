<h3>Java ExecutorService Framework and Core Synchronizers (Assignment 2 - Part A)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Objectives and Overview of the Assignment</H4>

<P>The objective of the first part of this assignment is to learn how
to use the Java Executor Service framework.  Videos describing the
Java Executor Service appear <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf9ND5idTRg&t=65s&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=44">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtsLYfQlbaM&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=45">here</a>.
I recommend you watch these videos to ensure you understand the Java
Executor Service.  Naturally, we'll cover these topics in class, as
well. </P>

<P>In this part of the assignment you will use an instance of the Java
<CODE>ExecutorService</CODE> class that's created as a "fixed-size"
pool of threads to enhance the multi-threaded implementation of the
PalantiriSimulator app from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5254/tree/master/assignment1a/">Assignment
1A</A>. Assignment 2A focuses on creating a pool of threads that allow
beings to concurrently gaze into a fixed number of palantiri.  By now,
you should understand what <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir">palantiri</a> are!</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project using the
latest version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin
and Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the
purposes of Assignment 2A, however, you only need to be aware of the
following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/executorService/">simulator/managers/beings/executorService</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of unit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for this assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.  <P>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The app's
minimum API is 29, so you will need to select an emulator that uses an
API >= 29, though I recommend you use API 30.  If you don't already
have an emulator created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD
Manager" button in the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/executorService">executorService</A>
folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/executorService/ExecutorServiceMgr.java">ExecutorServiceMgr.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to
implement a BeingManager via a fixed-size thread pool using the Java
<CODE>ExecutorService</CODE> class. </P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/beings/executorService/BeingCallable.java">BeingCallable.java</A>.
You'll need to complete a couple of methods in this class. </P>

<LI> <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/utils/Student.kt">Student.kt</A>.
You need to complete the "TODO" task to set the <CODE>type</CODE>
field to either <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or <CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI> <P>

</UL>

<P>You'll also need to integrate your solution for the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/palantiri/spinLockHashMap">spinLockHashMap</A>
folder from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5254/tree/master/assignment1b/">Assignment
1B</a> into the latest/greatest <CODE>spinLockHashMap</CODE> skeleton
and use it as implementation of the PalantiriManager for Assignment
2A.  In Assignment 2B you'll revise the PalantiriManager solution to
use a new and different group of Java synchronizers. </P>

<P>Your app will be considered correct if it (1) passes all the unit
and instrumentation tests and (2) all beings successfully complete all
their N iterations.  A correct simulation should restrict the number
of gazing Beings to the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there
are four Palantiri in the simulation, then only four Beings should
ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show Palantiri and Being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct---and does not throw any exceptions---then the app title bar
labels will appear <EM>green</EM> when the simulation completes. If
your solution is not implemented correctly---or throws an
exception---then <EM>red</EM> title bar labels will be displayed when
the simulation completes.</P>

<H4>Additional "TO DO" Tasks for Graduate Students</H4>

<P>Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for
graduate credit) must perform the following additional task(s):</P>

<UL>

<LI> Enhance the <CODE>ExecutorServiceMgr.java</CODE> file to use Java
functional programming features (e.g., method references and/or lambda
expressions).  Likewise, if you are familiar with the Java Streams
framework please feel free to apply it to your solution.

</UL>

<P>Undergraduates are welcome to implement these methods/features, but
it's not required.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from
my <A HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5254/tree/master/assignment2a/">GitHub</a>
account.  Now that you've setup
your <A HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can
pull this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
complete the "TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate
students is clearly indicated.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A> folder
are provided to increase our confidence that your implementation is
working as expected.  It's essential that you use the Android Studio
GUI to run these unit tests locally on your computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code.  However, please run these tests prior to submitting your
solution and make sure to seek help if you have questions about why
any of the tests fail. </p>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This assignment is designed to deepen your knowledge of writing
concurrent Java programs using the thread pool features provided by
the Java Executor Service framework, which enhances the core Java
multi-threading mechanisms we focused on in Assignment 1A.  It doesn't
require you to program any other Java or Android concurrency
frameworks, which we'll cover later.</P>
